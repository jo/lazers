<h1 id="laze-rs">Laze RS</h1>
<p>What could become a CouchDB-client in Rust.</p>
<p>Uses literate programming through <a href="tango">https://github.com/pnkfelix/tango</a> and tries hard to build nice APIs.</p>
<p><a href="It%20is%20pronouced" title="Laze RS">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/laze</a>.</p>
<h2 id="project-state">Project state</h2>
<p>This is currently mostly API experiments. I'm searching for help with many of them.</p>
<p>Contributors welcome!</p>

<h2 id="notable-specialties">Notable specialties</h2>
<h3 id="use-of-tango">Use of Tango</h3>
<p>Tango is used to provide richer documentation by using literate programming to make writing descriptions the default.</p>
<h3 id="documentation-driven-development">Documentation-driven development</h3>
<p>Features, as experimental as they may be, should never be committed without extensive documentation.</p>
<p>This hasn't been followed through in the past and has been fixed, but there might be spots. These spots shouldn't happen again.</p>
<h3 id="use-of-decorated-results">Use of decorated results</h3>
<p>Decorated results allow a form of result chaining that hides error handling until the very last step.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://yakshav.es/decorating-results/">yakshav.es/decorating-results/</a> about how decorated results work.</p>
<h2 id="current-setup">Current Setup</h2>
<p>The project currently consists of the following crates:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://laze.rs/lazers-traits/src/lib/">lazers-traits</a>: A set of traits without implementations that describe the general interface towards a CouchDB(-like) database. It defines error and result types and interactions for writing and reading documents.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://laze.rs/lazers-hyper-client/src/lib/">lazers-hyper-client</a>: A client implementing lazers-traits for a remote CouchDB using hyper. Currently also serves as an implementation example for the interface described in lazers-traits.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://laze.rs/lazers-changes-stream/src/lib/">lazers-changes-stream</a>: An implementation of the CouchDB changes stream protocol. It is generic over any <code>Read</code> interface, so it depends on no http client.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://laze.rs/lazers-replicator/src/lib/">lazers-replicator</a>: A (currently unfinished) implementation of the CouchDB replication protocol. Important features of the base libraries were missing, but it is still around as a placeholder or as a way to start.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://laze.rs/lazers-liblazers/src/lib/">lazers-liblazers</a>: A C interface to the library. Still figuring a good way to do this. This interface is important, see <a href="#long-term-goals">Long-Term Goals</a></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notably-missing">Notably missing</h2>
<ul>
<li>A second implementation of the lazers-traits interface for a local database</li>
<li>A good way to compile the md source documents into a doc site</li>
<li>A switch to tokio/futures-rs. I think this is the... future, so at some point the whole interface would need to be switched over.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="long-term-goals">Long-term goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>Provide a way to use Laze RS on iOS and Android similar to CouchBase lite.</li>
<li>Provide bindings towards several programming languages like Ruby/Python</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="constraints">Constraints</h2>
<p>The library itself uses plain Serde for serialisation and deserialisation, this means some boilerplate work is required.</p>
<h2 id="credits">Credits</h2>
<p>Hat tip to https://lobste.rs/u/gsquire for the final name idea.</p>
